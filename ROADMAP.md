# Backlog of things to add:

## Database

Integrate a database/restful api to provide the data needed. Allowing us to save the data and reload it.

## User Interface Design

The design in the current application is very minimal. It would be nice to add further user interface design to improve the user experience. Picking a color scheme would help to improve the user interface. More detailed use of styling, flex and layout to make sure things are lined up better and look neater.

## Create more pages

Need to be able to open one particular Job into a new page/window with a unique id so we can share the link to that job.
