## Excerise Front-End A - Creating an offer
I chose this because I want to work a Front-End developer job. I have more experience with this than the back-end task.

## What I built:
I tried to follow the task as closely as possible. I started with a brief design document and then built the navbar. Next I implemented the core task which was to have a page for managers to create new job offers and a second page for employees to look at a list of jobs that they had been sent. I used accordian's with lists to make the lists of job offers for both pages.

## How to run:
I was just using npm start in the folder and viewing on local host.

## Feedback notes:
I found it confusing that there was no api/backend for me to utilise. I would have liked for example a restful api that let me save job offers and load job offers in accordingly. I spent sometime trying to understand how I could get a link to a specific job to send to a specific user due to lack of back-end services. To this end, I just generated fake data in the soruce code to try to show how the data would be displayed. (employee page).

## Testing:
Due to my time limit running out I was not able to add tests within the 3hr time limit. I do have experience using TDD with c# /.net framework, as well as experience using Juint with Java and Jest with React native.

## Anything else:
During my degree I used React Native extensively and have much more experience in ReactNative than React, but I know I could improve very fast if I started using React everyday. I know that with time I could have made this asseessment application exponentially better as I feel it is a bit rubbish right now, but I tried to stick to the under 3 hours time limit.
